# SMART-PET: A Self-SiMilARiTy-Aware Generative Adversarial Framework for Reconstructing Low-count [18F]-FDG-PET Imaging
# Introduction
This repository will hold the codes for SMART-PET a state-of-the-art method for reconstructing low-count Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. It leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize high-quality PET images from low-dose counterparts1. The goal of this method is to reduce the radiation exposure from PET while maintaining adequate image quality.
